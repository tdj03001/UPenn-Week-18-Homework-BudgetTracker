# UPenn-Week-18-Homework-BudgetTracker


# Purpose

Users want to be able to keep track of their debits and credits transactions with the ability to use the app online as well as offline. Budget Tracker is here to provide simple platform for anyone to keep a log of their activities.

# Usage

Users will create a new workout by clicking the New Workout button on the home page. Next they will select an exercise type (resistance or cardio) and they will be presented with a list of data points they can fill in. If there was just one exercise to be logged for that workout, users will click the Complete button and the data will be saved to the database for future review/analysis. If there is more than one exercise to be logged, users will click the Add Exercise button to add each exercise for that workout.  

Users can also click the Dashboard button to see graphs and charts summarizing their past workouts.
